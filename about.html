                        <h2>I'm Ray Paull — and I See What Others Miss</h2>

                        <p>Five years ago, I picked up a pickleball paddle with some friends, expecting a casual backyard game. What I found instead was an obsession. Within months, I was drilling daily. Within a year, I was competing. Today, I compete at the <strong>pro tournament level</strong> with a <strong>5.1 DUPR rating</strong>, including competing at <strong>PPA Vegas 2023</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Along the way, I developed something valuable: an eye for patterns. When I watch pickleball, I don't just see shots — I see <strong>tendencies, percentages, and opportunities</strong>. I started tracking stats for myself, then for training partners. The results were eye-opening. Players who thought they knew their game discovered blind spots they never knew existed.</p>

                        <p>Now I'm offering that same analysis to you.</p>

                        <h3>My Analysis Approach</h3>

                        <p><strong>Numbers don't lie. Patterns reveal everything.</strong></p>

                        <p>When I watch your footage, I'm not just giving opinions — I'm tracking real statistics. How often do you get to the kitchen after your serve? What percentage of your third shots are drives vs. drops? Where do your unforced errors come from? Which wing is more reliable under pressure?</p>

                        <p>This data-driven approach reveals patterns you can't see in the heat of the game. And once you see them, you can fix them.</p>

                        <h3>Why Video Analysis?</h3>
                        <ul class="philosophy-list">
                            <li><strong>You can't fix what you can't see.</strong> Most players have no idea where their points are actually coming from (or going).</li>
                            <li><strong>Feelings lie, numbers don't.</strong> You might think you're driving too much on third shot, but the data might show your drops are the real problem.</li>
                            <li><strong>One clear focus beats ten vague tips.</strong> I'll give you the #1 thing to work on — the fix that will make the biggest difference.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why Trust My Analysis?</h3>
                        <ul class="credentials-list">
                            <li><strong>5.1 DUPR rating</strong> — I compete at the highest levels</li>
                            <li><strong>PPA Vegas 2023 competitor</strong> — I've played against the best on the pro tour</li>
                            <li><strong>5+ years of dedicated play</strong> — thousands of hours on the court</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal training background</strong> — I understand athletic movement and biomechanics</li>
                            <li><strong>Systematic tracking methodology</strong> — 15+ stats tracked per video</li>
                        </ul>
